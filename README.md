You know that problem, where there's so many different types of cheeses in your fridge, that you lose track of 'em?!

Yeah, me neither, I've never had that issue. Never. Never, never, ever.

But say we did. To solve this "hypothetical" problem, let's build a psql database that will organize all the cheeses.

## Mission

Create a `cheeses_db` database as a collection to store cheeses. Each document should store a **name, color, origin, and stink_level**.

Keep track of your commands! Write out your answers in the provided `cheeses.sql.`

## Setup

Work directly in PSQL. Run `psql` in your terminal.

**Exception** - Wanna write a seed file for all the cheese info (located in the section below)? Go for it!

#### Buying Cheese

Add these cheeses to your database:

- Roquefort, a yellow french cheese with a stink level of 5
- Epoisses, an orange french cheese with a stink level of 9
- Charolais, a white french cheese with a stink level of 5
- Maroilles, a white french cheese with a stink level of 10
- Durrus, a yellow Irish cheese with a stink level of 2
- Hooligan, a yellow American cheese with a stink level of 3
- Teleme, a white american cheese with a stink level of 2
- Stichelton, a white English cheese with a stink level of 4

#### Choosing Cheese

Now write PostgreSQL queries to accomplish the following:

- Find all the cheeses
- Find all the French cheeses
- Find all the English cheeses
- Find all cheeses with a stink level of 2
- Find all cheeses with a stink level of 10
- Find all French cheeses with a stink level of 5
- Find all Irish cheeses with a stink level of 6
- Find all cheeses with a stink level of at least 4, but no greater than 8.
- Find all American and English cheeses.
- Find all cheeses that are not from France.

**TIP** Stuck? Check the [PG documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)!

#### Restocking Cheese

The cheese game is changing constantly. Let's update our cheeses. Save your queries after you get them working in the command line.

- Change the stink level of Roquefort to 3
- Change the color of Teleme to "mauve"
- Delete the Hooligan cheese
- Change the stink level of Stichelton to be 7
- Add the cheese "Monterey Jack", an American cheese with a stink level of 0
- Delete Durrus
- Change the stink level of Teleme to be 1
- Delete Epoisses
- Change "Monterey Jack" to "Pepper Jack"
